# command-palette-chrome

I want to make a command palette for a Chrome Extension like when you press Ctrl+Shift+P in VSCode. It should:

- List all known commands
- Filter through commands as you type
- When you hit enter, it runs the command you have selected
- When you click on a command from the list, run that command

It should appear on any page, as the topmost element (i.e the z-index should be the highest on the page).

It should be activated when you press a key combination.

Ideally, it would be in TypeScript using no imports (just the web API and no other libraries)
